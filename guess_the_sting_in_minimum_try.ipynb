    "- Game Type: Puzzle\n",
    "- Objective: Guess a 6-character combination from the letters A to J\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gameplay Instructions\n",
    "- The computer generates a random 6-character combination from the letters A to J.\n",
    "- The player inputs a 6-character guess.\n",
    "- The computer validates the guess and provides feedback in the form of character and position \n",
    "\n",
    "* Scores.\n",
    "- The player keeps guessing until they correctly guess the combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constraints\n",
    "- The combination can contain duplicate characters.\n",
    "- The player's guess must be exactly 6 characters long.\n",
    "- The player's guess must only contain letters from A to J.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scoring\n",
    "- Character Score: Number of characters in the guess that appear in the combination (regardless of position)\n",
    "- Position Score: Number of characters in the guess that appear in the correct position in the combination\n",
    "\n",
    "* Winning Condition\n",
    "- The player correctly guesses the 6-character combination (Position Score of 6)"
