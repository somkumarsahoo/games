    "    - The computer generates a random 6-character combination\n",
    "    - The player inputs a 6-character guess\n",
    "    - The computer validates the guess and provides feedback in the form of character and position scores\n",

    "- Scoring:\n",
    "    - Character Score: Number of characters in the guess that appear in the combination (regardless of position)\n",
    "    - Position Score: Number of characters in the guess that appear in the correct position in the combination\n",
